How It Works:
   The game will present a riddle to the user.
   The user is prompted to answer the riddle.
   If the answer is incorrect, the game offers a hint.
   The user is then allowed to answer again after the hint.
  The game asks whether the user wants to continue to the next riddle or stop.
  The game keeps track of the score and shows it at the end.
